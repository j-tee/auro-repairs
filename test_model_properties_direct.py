üéØ THE ISSUE IDENTIFIED:

1. EMPLOYEE MODEL ‚úÖ
   - Has @property methods for computed fields
   - Properties work correctly on model instances
   - current_appointments, workload_count, is_available, etc.

2. EMPLOYEE API (EmployeeSerializer) ‚ùå 
   - Uses fields = "__all__" 
   - DRF ModelSerializer ONLY includes database fields
   - @property methods are NOT automatically included
   - Missing: current_appointments, workload_count, is_available

3. WORKLOAD API (Custom View) ‚úÖ
   - Manually calls the @property methods
   - tech.workload_count, tech.is_available, etc.
   - Constructs custom response with computed data
   - Available at: /api/shop/technicians/workload/

üìã DOCUMENTATION PROBLEM:
The frontend documentation suggests computed properties are available 
in regular Employee API responses, but they're only available via 
the specialized workload endpoint.

üîß SOLUTIONS:
A) Update documentation to clarify which endpoint provides which data
B) Enhance EmployeeSerializer to include computed properties
C) Create separate TechnicianSerializer for technician-specific needs
