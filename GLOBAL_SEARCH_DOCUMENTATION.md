# Global Search API - How It Works

## ‚úÖ Global Search is Working Correctly!

The global search for "toyota" returns **2 results**, which is the correct behavior:

### Search Results for "toyota":
1. **1 Vehicle**: Alice Cooper's Toyota Camry (2020) - matches "toyota" in make field
2. **1 Customer**: Alice Cooper - returned because she owns a Toyota vehicle
3. **Total: 2 results**

## üîç How Global Search Works

The global search endpoint `/api/shop/search/?q=<term>` searches across three categories:

### 1. **Vehicle Search**
Finds vehicles where the search term appears in:
- `make` (e.g., "Toyota")
- `model` (e.g., "Camry") 
- `vin` (VIN number)
- `license_plate` (license plate)
- `color` (vehicle color)

**For "toyota" search**: Finds 1 vehicle (Toyota Camry)

### 2. **Customer Search** 
Finds customers where the search term appears in:
- `name` (customer name)
- `email` (customer email)
- `address` (customer address)
- `phone_number` (customer phone)
- `vehicles__make` (make of vehicles they own)
- `vehicles__model` (model of vehicles they own)

**For "toyota" search**: Finds 1 customer (Alice Cooper owns a Toyota)

### 3. **Repair Order Search**
Finds repair orders where the search term appears in:
- `notes` (repair notes)
- `vehicle__make` (make of vehicle being repaired)
- `vehicle__model` (model of vehicle being repaired)
- `vehicle__vin` (VIN of vehicle being repaired)

**For "toyota" search**: Finds any repair orders for Toyota vehicles

## üéØ Why This is Correct

When a user searches for "toyota", they likely want to find:
1. **All Toyota vehicles** in the system ‚úÖ
2. **All customers who own Toyota vehicles** ‚úÖ 
3. **All repair orders for Toyota vehicles** ‚úÖ

This provides comprehensive results that help users find everything related to their search term.
