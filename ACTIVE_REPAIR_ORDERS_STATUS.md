# Active Repair Orders Implementation Status

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE AND FIXED

The Active Repair Orders endpoint has been successfully implemented and the TypeError has been resolved. Here's the complete status:

### Endpoint Details
- **URL**: `GET /api/shop/repair-orders/active/`
- **Authentication**: Required (JWT Bearer token)
- **Purpose**: Returns repair orders linked to vehicles with pending or in-progress appointments

### Implementation Location
File: `shop/views.py` - RepairOrderViewSet class

```python
@action(detail=False, methods=["get"])
def active(self, request):
    """Get active repair orders (linked to pending or in-progress appointments)"""
    orders = self.get_queryset().filter(
        vehicle__appointments__status__in=["pending", "in_progress"]
    ).distinct()
    serializer = self.get_serializer(orders, many=True)
    return Response(serializer.data)
```

### Key Architecture Decision
✅ **No separate status field on RepairOrder model** - RepairOrders access appointment status through the vehicle relationship
✅ **Uses appointment status** - Filters by `vehicle__appointments__status` instead of a dedicated RepairOrder status field
✅ **Maintains data integrity** - Single source of truth for status through the appointment system

### Features Implemented
✅ Filters repair orders by vehicles with "pending" and "in_progress" appointments
✅ Uses optimized database queries with select_related/prefetch_related
✅ Role-based permissions (requires authentication)
✅ Returns complete repair order data including:
   - Order details (ID, total cost, dates)
   - Customer information (via vehicle relationship)
   - Vehicle information
   - Associated appointment details (via vehicle.appointments)
   - Services and parts

### Database Optimization
The endpoint uses optimized queryset from RepairOrderViewSet:
- `select_related("vehicle", "vehicle__customer")`
- `prefetch_related("repair_order_services__service", "repair_order_parts__part", "vehicle__appointments")`
- `distinct()` to avoid duplicates when multiple appointments exist for a vehicle

### Error Resolution
✅ **Fixed TypeError**: Removed 'status' from RepairOrder model filterset_fields
✅ **Corrected relationship logic**: Uses vehicle → appointments → status instead of direct RepairOrder status
✅ **Updated queryset**: Added vehicle__appointments prefetch for efficient data access

### Testing Status
✅ Endpoint responds correctly
✅ Authentication requirement enforced
✅ Returns proper JSON structure
✅ Integrates with existing RBAC system

### Additional Enhancements Also Available
The RepairOrderViewSet also includes:
1. **Statistics Endpoint**: `GET /api/shop/repair-orders/stats/`
   - Total orders, active orders, completed orders
   - Revenue analytics, average order value
   - Orders by appointment status breakdown
   - Monthly order counts

2. **Enhanced Filtering**: Available query parameters:
   - `vehicle` - Filter by vehicle ID
   - `date_created` - Filter by creation date
   - Search by customer name, vehicle make/model, notes

### Frontend Integration Ready
The endpoint is ready for frontend integration with:
- Consistent API response format
- Proper error handling
- Authentication integration
- Complete data structure for UI display
- Efficient database queries to prevent N+1 problems

### Usage Example (with authentication)
```javascript
// Frontend usage
const response = await fetch('/api/shop/repair-orders/active/', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${your_jwt_token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const activeOrders = await response.json();
```

## Conclusion
The Active Repair Orders endpoint is **fully implemented, TypeError resolved, and ready for production use**. The implementation correctly uses the vehicle → appointment relationship to determine active status, maintaining proper data architecture without duplicate status fields.
